# Movie finder

## Project description

Hi Love To Know team!  
  
Here you can find the assignment, feel free to run it locally because for some reason the build is not working. Unfortunately I don't have the time to spend time to debug that.  
I don't want to take more than one week for this assignment so I prefer deliver it as this event with production issues.  
I pushed the environnement file son you can test it directly.  
  
### What the product doas:
  
- Display a search page at `/` containing a search bar.
- As a user, you can type for a movie title and search by clicking on the button or press `Enter`.
- If no errors, you should land on `/results` where you can see result movies list.
  - You can navigate using left and right arrow or pressing left/right keyboard arrows.
  - You can come back on the main page via the link on the top.
- If errors, like too much results (with `Dr ` for example) or no results you should see an alert message box.
- All the app if A11Y compliant, you can use only the keyboard to use it.
- All the app is mobile friendly.

### What the product doesn't:
  
- No test implemented.
- On `/results`, errors for fetching movies details aren't handled.
